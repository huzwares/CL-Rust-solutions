## About the Repository

The "Command-Line Rust" book is a fantastic resource for learning Rust programming through practical examples and exercises. This repository serves as a collection of solutions to the book's exercises. I have updated the solutions to work with the latest versions of the crates used in the book.


## Getting Started

To get started with these solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huzwares/CL-Rust-solutions.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd CL-Rust-solutions
```

Each exercise solution is located in its respective directory. To run an exercise solution, go to each chapter folder and run:
```bash
cargo run
```
This command will execute the Rust code associated with that chapter's exercise.
